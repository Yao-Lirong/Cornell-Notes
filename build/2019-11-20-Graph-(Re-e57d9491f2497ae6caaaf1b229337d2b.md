## Edge Classification

We have an edge `e=(v,child)`, where v is always grey

- Tree edge:

  ```java
  if (child.color==white)
  	e = TreeEdge;
  ```

  <!--more-->

- Back edge:

  ```java
  if (child.color==grey)
      e = BackEdge;
  ```

- Forward edge:

  ```java
  if (child.color==black && v.timeStamp<child.timeStamp)
      e = ForwardEdge;
  ```

- Cross edge:

  ```java
  if (child.color==black && v.timeStamp > child.timeStamp)
      e = ForwardEdge;
  ```
