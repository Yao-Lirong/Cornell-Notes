In the following discussion, the vector space is of dimension $d$ and has basis $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_d$

## Vector Space

a vector space over the real numbers is a set $V$ together with two binary operations $+$ (mapping $V \times V$ to $V$) and $\cdot$ (mapping $\R \times V$ to $V$) satisfying the following axioms for any $x, y, z \in V$ and $a, b \in \R$ 

- **closure**: $x + y \in V$ and $a \cdot x = ax \in V$ 
- **associativity of addition**: $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$ 
- **transitivity of addition**: $x + y = y + x$ 
- **negation**: there exists a $(-x)$ such that $x + (-x) = 0$ 
- **zero element**: $0 \in V$ such that $0 + x = x + 0 = x$ 
- **associativity of scalar multiplication**: $a(bx) = b(ax) = (ab)x$ 
- **multiplication by one**: $1v = v$ 
- **distributivity**: $a(x+y) = ax + ay$ and $(a+b)x = ax + bx$ 

## Vector

Any vector $v$ in the vector space can be written uniquely as the following for some real numbers $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots$

$$
v = \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \cdots + \alpha_d x_d
$$
Therefore, to represent $v$ on a computer, it suffices to store $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\ldots$, and $\alpha_d$. We store these alphas in an array and this gets us back to our CS-style notion of what a vector is.

## Linear Map

We say a function $F$ from a vector space $U$ to a vector space $V$ is a **linear map** if for any $x, y \in U$ and any $a \in \R$,

$$
F(ax + y) = a F(x) + F(y)
$$
Note if we want to define a linear map, it suffices to just write out $F(x_i)$ for all basis. Say $|x_i| = d =m, |F(x_i)| = n$, we can then represent a linear map with $m\times n$ number: each $F(x_i)$ needs $n$ numbers and there are $m$ $F(x_i)$ 

## Matrix

We have basically introduced the "matrix" in above. We call this two-dimensional-array representation of a linear map a **matrix**.

We use multiplication to denote the effect of a matrix operating on a vector (this is equivalent to applying a multilinear map as a function). E.g. if $F$ is the multilinear map corresponding to matrix $A$:
$$
y = F(x) \iff y = Ax \\
F:\R^m \to \R^n \iff A \in \R^{n \times m} 
$$
We can add two matrices, scale a matrix by a scalar, and these two operations follow the "axioms" described above for a vector space. This means that the set of matrices $\R^{n \times m}$ **is itself a vector space**. (This was covered in MATH3360)

## Broadcasting

When operate on vectors / matrices, numpy broadcasts by acting as if there are infinite $1\times$ to the left of dimension:

```python
if dimension of array not same:
    append newaxis to the lesser one until same
    if on a specific axis, one array has dim 1 and the other has > 1:
        broadcast that 1 axis to match dimension
    else:
        fail
```

However, it is good practice for you to always **manually add dimension** before broadcasting.

```python
x = numpy.array([2,3])
x1 = x[numpy.newaxis,:]
```
