## Compilers and Interpreters

### Compilers

- translation: source program -> target program
- better performance: target program is faster

### Interpreters

- execute the program in the most direct way
- easier to implement 

### Virtual Machine

- program written for virtual machines can be run cross-platform, as long as virtual machine is installed
- security: can limit what the program can do

## Architecture of Compiler and Interpreter

- Front End: source code -> AST -> (IR) intermediate representation

  1. Lexical Analysis with lexer

  2. Syntactic Analysis with parser

  3. Semantic Analysis 

- Back End:

  - Interpreter: executes AST or IR
  - Compiler: translates IR into machine code
